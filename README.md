# Pig-Latin
Write a program that will take a word and output the pig latin version of the word by following the following rules:  1. If the word starts with a consonant or group of consonants, move all letters before the first vowel to the end of the word then add "ay". Example: will -> illway dog -> ogday category -> ategorycay chatter -> atterchay trash -> ashtray  2. If the word starts with a vowel, simply add "way" to the end of the word. Example: andela - andelaway electrician - electricianway
